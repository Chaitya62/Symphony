Each year KJSCE undertakes social initiatives based on relevant issues in the society. Abhiyantriki having a diverse crowd and a large reach is an ideal platform for promoting social causes. It created awareness amongst the 4000+ students that attended Symphony, and thousands others in various colleges. Parvaah promises to be a platform to reach out to the mass and bring in the change. </p> </div> <div class="col-lg-1"></div> </div> </header> <!-- Page Content --> <hr class="featurette-divider"> <!-- First Featurette --> <!--     <div class="featurette" id="about">\n                                    <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="images/station.e97f5870.jpg">\n                                    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Beautification of Ghatkopar Station\n                                        <span class="text-muted"></span>\n                                    </h2>\n                                    <p class="lead">In this event, Team Parvaah cleaned and undertook the beautification of Ghatkopar station.
