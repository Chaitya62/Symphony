	With the T20 fever at its peak in India and the matches being played in far-away stadiums watching the matches on the television does not satisfy everyone. But to the relief of cricket fanatics, we 	at Symphony will give you a chance to watch the India vs England 3rd T20 live with just the ambience that you need. Make sure you grab this opportunity to watch the third T20 in the Auditorium 7pm onwards, on 1st of February 2017.
