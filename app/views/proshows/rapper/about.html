	We have Jaz Dhami and RaOol, two desi bred, international artists, who are sure to get you grooving and pumping to their rap. Do not miss their performance on 8th February 2017!

Their song, Desi Girls Do It Better is the first of its kind - A feminist hip-hop club anthem. It's meant to empower and to celebrate all the Desi girls worldwide and to acknowledge the achievements of these remarkable women, whose brilliance makes them the pride of our great nation.
